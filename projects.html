        <b> Ethrograpgy Research </b>
      </h1>

      <p>
       Correnty l am working on enthograhy reserch paper. In this ethnography assignment, 
        I researched the environment of a coffee shop. To perform my ethnography research upon 
        coffee shops in Middlesex County College’s (MCC) campus center. My ethnography research 
        is heavily focused on the activities associated with the customer in the cafeteria coffee 
        cafe at different times. Also, though my research is more concentrated towards behavior, 
        this considers gender plus time as major contributing factors. To conduct this assignment, 
        I visited the coffee shop found on the second floor of Middlesex County’s cafeteria.

        <b> Diary Study </b>
      </h1>

      <p>
        I am currently working in a Diary study assignment. 
        Diary study, I utilized the time tracker web application to follow my study 
        habits conduct for one week, to have a superior comprehension of my study patterns. 
        By tracking and recording the times I was studying, I was able to perceive how the time of 
        the day and the day of the week affect my study outlines. To record when I was studying, I 
        just tapped the Start Time button to record the present time stamp and to begin a timer in the
        background. Once, I was finished studying I tapped the Stop Time button to stop the timer and to 
        record the present timestamp. Each time I finished a studying session, I had the option to perceive to
        what extent the session was and what date it was on.
