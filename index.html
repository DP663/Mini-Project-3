        <h1> About me </h1>
        <p>
           My name is Donark Patel, I am a full-time student at NJIT. I am a junior and my major is Information Technology. I graduated from Middlesex County College with an Associate degree in applied Science for Computer and Information Systems. I am certified in Windows/PC Support, Java & Web Programming, Java Programming, and Network Administration.
I love challenges because they force me to improve myself as a person. I live my life with a simple strategy of making goals and dedicating everything I have to accomplish my goals.

          Correnty l am working on enthograhy reserch paper. In this ethnography assignment, I researched the environment of a coffee shop. 
          To perform my ethnography research upon coffee shops in Middlesex County College’s (MCC) campus center. 
          My ethnography research is heavily focused on the activities associated with the customer in the cafeteria coffee cafe at 
          different times. Also, though my research is more concentrated towards behavior, this considers gender plus time as major 
          contributing factors. To conduct this assignment, I visited the coffee shop found on the second floor of Middlesex County’s 
          cafeteria.

          I am currently working in a Diary study assignment. For Diary study, I utilized the time tracker web application to follow 
          my study habits conduct for one week, to have a superior comprehension of my study patterns. By tracking and recording the 
          times I was studying, I was able to perceive how the time of the day and the day of the week affect my study outlines. 
          To record when I was studying, I just tapped the Start Time button to record the present time stamp and to begin a timer 
          in the background. Once, I was finished studying I tapped the Stop Time button to stop the timer and to record the present 
          timestamp. Each time I finished a studying session, I had the option to perceive to what extent the session was and what date 
          it was on.
